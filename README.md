Access to Restricted Content: Allows access to geo-blocked websites, apps, and streaming services.
Safe Public Wi-Fi Use: Protects your data when connected to public or unsecured networks.
Anonymity: Helps maintain anonymity by masking your digital footprint.
Limitations of a VPN:
Reduced Speed: May slow down your internet connection due to encryption and server routing.
Limited Features in Free Plans: Free VPNs often have data caps, fewer servers, and slower speeds.
Not 100% Anonymous: VPNs can't protect against all threats (e.g., malware or phishing).
Trust Issues: Some VPNs log data or are based in countries with strict data laws.
Blocked by Some Services: Certain websites or streaming platforms block VPN traffic.
